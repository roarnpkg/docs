Lets learn how to install the Roarn CLI so you can get going creating games, and packages with Roarn.

## Installing Node.js

Installing the Roarn CLI which will allow you to initialize, publish and add packages to the Roarn registry will require **Node.js v14+**.

To install Node.js you can go to their [website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## After Installing Node.js

After you have finished installing Node.js successfully you will now have access to **npm** which is Node.js' package manager.

To install the Roarn CLI run:

```bash
npm install --global roarn
```

After that you will have access to the `roarn` command.

Run `roarn --help` to learn all of Roarn's commands.
